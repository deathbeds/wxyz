Get [Mambaforge][]. Start a dev environment from a [lockfile][], list tasks, launch Lab:

    mamba create --prefix envs/docs --file .github/locks/conda.docs.linux-64-3.8-3.0.lock
    source activate envs/docs
    doit list --status --all
    doit lab

[mambaforge]: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases
[lockfile]: ./.github/locks

## Use doit

Local development and continuous integration are both driven by [pydoit](https://pydoit.org/contents.html).

### View all doit commands

    doit list

> `--all` and `--status` can be combined for a lot of quick information.

    doit list --all --status | sort

### Run everything up to development

    doit

> This actually runs the `binder` task, which is used in `postBuild` for the
> interactive demo

The equivalent of _starting_ Binder is:

    doit lab

### Do everything to prepare for a release

    doit release

### Do everything to prepare the docs site

    doit release
    doit docs

> This is two un-coupled `doit` runs, so that it possible to replace notebook
> widget data or screenshots "hot" without worry too much about where they came
> from.

### Live Development

To rebuild the labextension and your JupyterLab, use:

    doit watch:lab

> When new files are created, it is usually necessary to re-start the watch command,
> stop it with <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>.

Semi-incompatibly, you can live run the docs build process (with some limitations)

    doit watch:docs

## Testing

### Notebooks

Tests are primarily captured as executable notebooks imported or linked to from
the [notebook index](src/py/wxyz_notebooks/src/wxyz/notebooks/index.ipynb).

Each notebook should:

- have a descriptive name
- demonstrate the value provided by the widgets in question as simply as possible
- provide a higher-level confection of `wxyz` widgets, usually a DockBox
- be imported into the index, unless it has very taxing, less-portable dependencies

### Robot Framework Testing

Where appropriate, individual components should be tested with Robot Framework
tests. Ideal tests include thoroughly exercising the demo notebooks as a user would.

    doit robot

## Code Style

Code style is enforced by a number of python, typescript and miscellaneous files
(e.g. YAML, JSON).

    doit lint*

## Updating lockfiles

The lockfiles in `.github/locks` are created in a separate environment from the main
development environment to avoid a `conda` dependency. `mamba` is recommended, as
many solutions are run.

    mamba create --prefix envs/lock --file .github/locks/conda.lock.linux-64-3.8-.lock
    source envs/lock/bin/activate
    doit list --all --status
    CONDA_EXE=mamba CONDARC=.github/.condarc doit -n8 lock
